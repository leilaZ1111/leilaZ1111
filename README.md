### Hi, I'm Leila üëã

I am a Front End Developer with a deep passion for technology and communication. My journey into the world of coding began in May 2023 when I immersed myself in an intensive full-time bootcamp in Web Development. Since then, I have been on a continuous learning journey to enhance my skills.

Currently, I am working with React and Ionic technologies. My ultimate aim is to excel in web responsiveness and UI/UX design, with the goal of creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences.

At my core, I am driven by a desire to make a positive impact on society through the fusion of technology and communication. My mission is to empower beautiful ideas, projects, and organizations by giving them a meaningful presence in the digital world.
